	  <h2>Why Software Development?</h2>
	  <div>
	  <p>Growing up, I was one of those kids who didnâ€™t want to become an adult.  
	  Therefore, when high school graduation came knocking, 
	  I had to very quickly come to a decision about my future career.  
	  I settled on software development because of my interest in learning game development. 
	  Since gaming is one of my hobbies, I thought it would be amazing if I could combine something I love, 
	  with something practical that I can fall back on. However, after learning more about software development,
	  it was far more interesting than I thought it would be, and have learned many things.
	  Now, I can confidently say, I have no regrets.</p><br>
	  </div>
	  <h2>Personal Life</h2>

	  <div>
	  <p>I was born in a small town in Northern California called Greenwood, 
	  and moved to Idaho when I was almost two years old.  
	  I am the youngest of five, with a sister and three brothers.  
	  Since my older brothers were the catalyst for my love of gaming,
	  it is something I enjoy doing with them.</p><br>
	  </div>
	  <h2>Interests</h2>
	  <div>
	  <p>Being true to my half Japanese and half Chinese heritage, aside from playing video games, 
	  I also enjoy listening to music, watching anime, 
	  and consuming other various types of mostly Asian entertainment. 
	   I am also learning Japanese and how to play the guitar as well.</p>
